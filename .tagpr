# config file for the tagpr in git config format
# The tagpr generates the initial configuration, which you can rewrite to suit your environment.
# CONFIGURATIONS:
#   tagpr.releaseBranch
#       Generally, it is "main." It is the branch for releases. The tagpr tracks this branch,
#       creates or updates a pull request as a release candidate, or tags when they are merged.
#
#   tagpr.versionFile
#       Versioning file containing the semantic version needed to be updated at release.
#       It will be synchronized with the "git tag".
#       Often this is a meta-information file such as gemspec, setup.cfg, package.json, etc.
#       Sometimes the source code file, such as version.go or Bar.pm, is used.
#       If you do not want to use versioning files but only git tags, specify the "-" string here.
#       You can specify multiple version files by comma separated strings.
#
#   tagpr.vPrefix
#       Flag whether or not v-prefix is added to semver when git tagging. (e.g. v1.2.3 if true)
#       This is only a tagging convention, not how it is described in the version file.
#
#   tagpr.changelog (Optional)
#       Flag whether or not changelog is added or changed during the release.
#
#   tagpr.command (Optional)
#       Command to change files just before release.
#
#   tagpr.template (Optional)
#       Pull request template in go template format
#
#   tagpr.release (Optional)
#       GitHub Release creation behavior after tagging [true, draft, false]
#       If this value is not set, the release is to be created.
#
#   tagpr.majorLabels (Optional)
#       Label of major update targets. Default is [major]
#
#   tagpr.minorLabels (Optional)
#       Label of minor update targets. Default is [minor]
#
